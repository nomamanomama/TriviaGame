# Ocean Trivia Game
Timed ocean trivia questions with answer and image playback.

## Example

A question is displayed with four answers below. A timer begins allowing 30 seconds to select (click) the correct answer. If the timer runs out or if an answer is selected, the answer screen is displayed with the correct answer, an explanation of the answer and a picture related to the answer. If the correct answer is selected, the number of correct answers is incremented. 

## Motivation

Ocean trivia was inspired by an OnBeing interview of Sylvia Earle (a well-known marine biologist nicknamed "Her Deepness") regarding her long career studying of the ocean and ocean life she has observed.
